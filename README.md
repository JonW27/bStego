## Config

bStego was built on the koding platform. Since koding is now koding for teams you'll have to find something that supports python cgi and pip installations to make full use of the python module powering this project: stegano. You should appropiately edit it the link so that it no longer says jonathanwong.koding.io and make your own file directory. Since this project uses python2.7 and stegano has moved on to python3 you'll have to make tweaks to the stegano code to get it working.
