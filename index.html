		<p>Why might you want to use steganography? Steganography is better than encryption since it
		    does not easily indicate that data is easily being hidden; one is less to suspect your meme as holding valuable data over weirdly 
		    looking text. A 2010 Russian spy ring is the most recent example I can think of that uses steganography. Steganography can also be used for the 
		    protection of your private property, hiding copyright text within your image that you can use as evidence in a legal case when someone steals your 
		    image.
